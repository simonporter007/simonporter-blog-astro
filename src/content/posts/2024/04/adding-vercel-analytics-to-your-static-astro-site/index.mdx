Vercel analytics is a great way to track your Astro site usage if you're already using Vercel for hosting, and the hobby plan bundles it for free!

There are [some limits for the hobby plans](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing), but if you're just getting started with a project, it certainly beats involving something heavy like Google Analytics. Vercel's analytics script comes in at a tiny **1.1kb** with no extra account setup. For that you get page views, unique visitors, and referrers.

As you grow you may find your analytics needs increase, but for a simple site, this is a great way to get started.

# Installation

It's a one click process to enable it in your account. So let's head on over to our Vercel dashboard > select the project we want to enable analytics for > select the analytics tab and then hit the **Enable** button to get started.

We then have a couple of different options to configure it for either **server** or **hybrid** output modes.

## Option A - Using Vercel's adaptor

Vercel has written up the instructions for adding the analytics script to your Astro site when using their adaptor in their [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/astro#using-vercel%27s-features-with-astro). This is the easiest way to get started, as it fits right alongside your Astro config.

First, use `astro` to install the Vercel adaptor, or manually install it with:

```sh
pnpm astro add vercel
# or manually install
pnpm add @vercel/astro
```

Then specify the Vercel adaptor in your Astro config and enable the analytics feature:

```ts
// for static/ssg output
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/static';
// for server/ssr output
// import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'static',
  adapter: vercel({
    webAnalytics: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  }),
});
```

After deploying this to change to production, we'll see the Vercel adaptor load our 1.1kb analytics script from the CDN `https://cdn.vercel-insights.com/v1/script.js`

## Option B - Manual install

This option is good for when we're running our Astro site in **static** output mode [^static] and don't want to involve the Vercel adaptor into our flow. **static** is the default mode for Astro, and it's the most performant way to run your site as all our pages are pre-rendered at build time.

To do this, we just need to add an additional script into our common **Head** or common **Layout**:

```html
<script>
  import { inject } from '@vercel/analytics';
  inject();
</script>
```

After adding this, we should start to see the analytics data in our Vercel dashboard. Loading the site also shows us the request being made to the `https://${ourDomain}/_vercel/insights/script.js` endpoint to load the tiny 1.1kb script.

And with that we're done!

<InfoBox type='warning'>
  <p>
    If a user of your site has a decent Adblocker, or is using a privacy focused
    browser, they may not be tracked by the Vercel analytics script.

    In my testing Brave seemed to still block the custom domain hosted
    `script.js` file too.

[^static]: SSG is static site generation. It's a way to pre-render your site at build time, and serve the static files to users. This is in contrast to SSR or 'server' mode (server-side rendering) where the server generates the HTML on each request.
